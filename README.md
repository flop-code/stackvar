# Stackvar Language
### Development state (not ready to run)
## About:
Stackvar is strongly typed interpreted programming language, developed in Python.
###### P.S. But also compiler is planned to be implemented.
Also, it is stack-oriented, functional language with variables!


## Some information about project and targets
I've created this project just for fun, so it's not very useful.

And also, I don't know english very well, so sorry, if you not
understand some descriptions and documentation...

My main goal is simple:
I am trying to improve this lang, to make it more useful.

Of course, it can look difficult, but it's not that hard, if you got the idea.

## Idea of language
* Use stack to operate with data and store temporary values.
* Use variables to store permanent values.
* Have fun ;)

## Idea of project (Why I created this project?)
* To **try to create** *something like* **my own programming language**, because I never do this before.
* **To get knowledge** and **improve my coding skills**.

# Usage (Tutorial)
* **Each** *Stackvar* file should have "**.stv**" extension
* To learn syntax, look at [example file](syntax.stv) which represents features and syntax of language.
* To learn how does it work look at [documentation](docs.txt).

## Other
* You can see the nearest plans with "**# todo**" comments in source files
