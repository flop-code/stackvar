Firsts, program reads the file (in src/main.py) and send it to lexer (in src/lexer.py).
Lexer returns list of tokens.

Token list:
[
    <data type> <value>,
    ...
]

Values is parsed from code.
To see possible data types, look at "src/StackvarTypes.py".

Next task is producing SVIL code from tokens (in src/parser.py)

SVIL: StackVar Intermediate Language

SVIL syntax:
<command> <value(s)>
...

Available commands:
    push - push value to stack
    rem - remove last value from stack
And so on, like in Stackvar syntax.

So SVIL is basically more strong version of Stackvar, but except of text, it uses tokens.

Then SVIL code goes to the interpreter, where it will be executed.

If you want to get more information, you can try to read source code.
I am trying to make it understandable and laconic.

I am glad, that you are interested in it. Thanks for reading.
