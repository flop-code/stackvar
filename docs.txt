Firsts, program reads the file (in src/main.py) and send it to lexer (in src/lexer.py).
Lexer returns list of tokens.

Token list:
[
    ( <data type> <value> ),
    ...
]

Data type could be INT, BOOL, STRING, VARIABLE_VALUE, VARIABLE_POINTER or FUNCTION.

Values is parsed from code.

Next task is producing SVIL code from tokens (in src/parser.py)

SVIL: StackVar Intermediate Language

It looks like this:
[
    ( <PUSHSTACK> <value> ),
    ( <EXEC> <function name> ),
    ( <GET> <variable name> )
    ...
]

As you can see, SVIL has only 3 commands.
"PUSHSTACK" to push value to stack, "EXEC" to execute function,
and "GET" to get the value of variable.

Then SVIL code goes to the interpreter, where it will be executed.

If you want to get more information, you can try to read source code and docstrings.
I am trying to make it understandable and laconic.

I am glad, that you are interested in it. Thanks for reading.
